# 2024-NCKUCTF-Pwn-Course

免費且公開的中文軟體安全課程 @ 2024 NCKUCTF Club

Free and open binary exploitation (pwn) course in mandarin I gave at 2024 NCKUCTF Club.

這是我第一次講授這門課程，所以投影片和上課的內容並不完美。我會在未來努力改進它們。

I'm the first time giving this course, so slides and lecture are not perfect. I will try to improve them in the future.
